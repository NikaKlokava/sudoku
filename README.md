### Project

- Sudoku is one of the most popular Japanese puzzle games based on the logical arrangement of numbers.
- The goal of Sudoku is to fill a grid with numbers so that each row, column and small grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 and they are not repeated.
- You can choose the field size (9x9, 4x4 or 6x6).
- Make the game more challenging by changing the game difficulty from "Easy" to "Impossible".
- Your progress will be saved, so you can play at any time convenient for you.
